% Typically, "This project is to <short description of porject> for/at <client>."
The objective of this project is to develop an application that will digitalize an activity designed to enhance student engagement through interactive learning experiences for Bagh e Sakina.
% About the client.
Bagh e Sakina is a non-profit organization dedicated to developing and implementing initiatives that uplift and empower children, providing them with the resources and support needed to ensure a brighter future. Their vision emphasizes that every child deserves fundamental rights and opportunities crucial for their well-being.

% About the project.
Striving to admit the most deserving students, Habib University uses \href{https://accuplacer.collegeboard.org}{ACCUPLACER} for its entrance test but wants to move to its own test. Faculty members will contribute questions to a pool and the new examination system will choose and present questions at random from the pool to each test taker. This will ensure that each test taker gets a unique test. For our Khidmat, we will build Habib University's new examination system.

% About the plan of work.
We will work full time on Habib University's premises under the supervision of their Admission Manager. The goal is to develop, test, and deploy the system by the end of our Khidmat.

\section*{Conclusion}

% Remind the reader about the project. Summarise your activities over the course of the project.
Our project was to build a new testing system for Habib University to replace ACCUPLACER for its entrance examination. We started by meeting all the stakeholders to understand their expectations from the new system. We then identified the necessary tools to build the required system and trained ourselves on them. Development and testing were carried out in collaboration with the IT team so that any shortcomings were identified and catered to as we went along. The system was then deployed and officers from the Admissions Team were trained to use it.
