\section*{Conclusion}

% Remind the reader about the project. Summarise your activities over the course of the project.
Our project was to build a new testing system for Habib University to replace
ACCUPLACER for its entrance examination. We started by meeting all the
stakeholders to understand their expectations from the new system. We then
identified the necessary tools to build the required system and trained
ourselves on them. Development and testing were carried out in collaboration
with the IT team so that any shortcomings were identified and catered to as we
went along. The system was then deployed and officers from the Admissions Team
were trained to use it.
