The team at Bagh-e-Sakina created an activity book with the purpose of engaging children with healthy activities and mindset. The activity book is a collection of activities ranging from describing your favourite hobbies to drawing things you love. The activities are designed to enhance student engagement, growth, and well-being. The purpose of this project is to develop an android mobile application that will digitalize the activity book and make it more accessible to distribute this activity book to different students. This will allow the students to engage with the activities in a more interactive and engaging way.
